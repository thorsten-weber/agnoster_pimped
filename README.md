# agnoster_pimped
oh-my-zsh / zsh agnoster.zsh-theme 
pimped for my needs with time and newline and shortended directory Listing in first line

Thanks to [nweedle](github.com/nweddle) for the newline part

Thanks to [agnoster](https://gist.github.com/agnoster)

Feel free to use it and to contribute on this.

## Usage
Copy to/ Install this under `your/path/to/oh-my-zsh/themes` and edit the correspondimng lines in your `.zshrc`

```sh
# Set name of the theme to load.
# Look in ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/
# Optionally, if you set this to "random", it'll load a random theme each
# time that oh-my-zsh is loaded.
ZSH_THEME="agnoster-pimped"
```

the other (and dirty) way ist to replace the original code in `agnoster.zsh-theme` by this one
